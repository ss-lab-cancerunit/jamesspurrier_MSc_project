Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the leading cause of kidney cancer-related deaths due to its propensity to metastasize, spreading malignant tumors to secondary tissues and organs. Understanding how tumor cells develop these malignant traits has been the focus of extensive and ongoing research, with recent evidence highlighting disrupted gene regulation as a key contributing factor. This study's primary goal was to identify genomic regions that control the expression of pro-metastatic genes in cell line models of metastatic renal carcinoma.

To identify regulatory interactions associated with metastasis, differential analyses were performed between non-metastatic and metastatic ccRCC cell lines, utilizing transcriptomic, epigenetic, and chromatin conformational data. The results from these differential multi-omics analyses were integrated to uncover gene-regulatory interactions linked to metastasis.
