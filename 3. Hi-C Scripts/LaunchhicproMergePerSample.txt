DO NOT EXECUTE AS QSUB BATCH JOB

This code runs HiC-Pro in stepwise mode to merge technical replicates.   

Run HiC-Pro in stepwise mode from the merge_persample stage, then build contact maps and perform normalisation. Merges valid pairs files for technical replicates. Used to generate a matrix of pooled replicates.
Ensure RM_DUP is set to 0 in the hic-pro-config.txt BEFORE merging replicates, otherwise contacts that appear in both will be marked as duplicates and removed!

Entered the following lines directly into the terminal...

$HOME/bin/HiC-Pro_3.1.0/bin/HiC-Pro -i $HOME/data/SRP107308/hicpro/2024-05-21/hic_results/data/validpairs -o $HOME/data/SRP107308/hicpro/merged_technical_replicates -c $HOME/ThesisProject/config/hic-pro-config.txt -s merge_persample -s build_contact_maps -s ice_norm -p

Upon executing the above directly in the terminal the following was returned:

'Run HiC-Pro 3.1.0 parallel mode
The following command will merge the processed data and run the remaining steps per sample:
qsub HiCPro_step2_SRP107308HicProRC2Rep2.sh'
